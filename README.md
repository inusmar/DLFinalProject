# Lyrics generation with RNN

In our project we can create new lyrics by using specific datasets. We will observe how our model can make new lyrics by learning from these datasets and make sense of the lyrics.

## Getting Started
1. Download all files and upload to Google Drive.
2. Open the .ipynb files using Google Colab.
3. Run the code.

## How to produce our results
1. Download data.zip from our repository and upload to your folder in GoogleDrive. Repite the process with the FinalProject.ipynb.

2. Check data_path. You might need different path.

3. As we explained in the presentation, we used two models, the first one was RNN and the second one was Long Short Term Memory. As we said, in the second model we obtained better results. 

4. If you want obtain the same results, you need to change the iterations when we train the RNN model next to "We start running the model with the tensorflow session."  
If you want obtain the same result in the second model, you need to change iterations when you train the model. We don't use the cluster, is possible that you need some hours to run all.
